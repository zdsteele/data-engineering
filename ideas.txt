1. ETL Pipeline with Real-World Data
Description: Build an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that fetches data from a public API, processes it, and loads it into a database or data warehouse.
Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Airflow), Databricks, Spark, AWS S3, PostgreSQL, or BigQuery.
Example:
Extract weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
Transform data to calculate daily/weekly weather trends.
Load the transformed data into a cloud database like AWS RDS or Google BigQuery.
2. Data Lake Architecture
Description: Create a data lake that ingests structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Implement partitioning and data cataloging.
Tech Stack: AWS S3, Glue, Athena, Spark, or Azure Data Lake.
Example:
Ingest JSON logs, CSV sales data, and images.
Use Spark to process and catalog the data.
Query the data using Athena or Presto.
3. Real-Time Data Pipeline
Description: Build a real-time streaming data pipeline for processing live data.
Tech Stack: Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, Python, Elasticsearch, or MongoDB.
Example:
Stream stock market data using Kafka.
Process the data with Spark Streaming to calculate moving averages.
Push the processed data to a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
4. Data Warehouse Integration
Description: Design and implement a dimensional data model in a data warehouse.
Tech Stack: Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, or PostgreSQL.
Example:
Build a star schema for e-commerce data (e.g., orders, customers, products).
Load the data using Python and SQL.
Create analytics dashboards using Tableau or Power BI.
5. Machine Learning Pipeline
Description: Create a pipeline that integrates machine learning model training and deployment into a data engineering workflow.
Tech Stack: Python (scikit-learn), Spark MLlib, MLflow, Docker.
Example:
Train a predictive model on housing price data.
Automate the data ingestion, training, and model deployment workflow.
Use MLflow to track model metrics and Dockerize the deployment.
6. Web Scraping and Data Processing
Description: Build a scraper to collect data from websites, clean it, and store it in a database.
Tech Stack: Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy), Pandas, SQLite, AWS.
Example:
Scrape job listings from websites like LinkedIn or Indeed.
Analyze trends in job skills and salaries.
Visualize insights using a dashboard.
7. Data Quality Monitoring
Description: Develop a framework for monitoring and ensuring data quality in pipelines.
Tech Stack: Python, Great Expectations, Airflow.
Example:
Validate schema consistency and check for null values in datasets.
Integrate alerts for data quality violations in a pipeline.
Document the quality checks and provide a report.
8. Batch vs. Streaming Analytics
Description: Compare batch and streaming data processing for the same dataset.
Tech Stack: Apache Spark, Kafka, Python.
Example:
Batch: Process a large dataset of user logs to calculate monthly activity.
Streaming: Process real-time user logs to calculate hourly activity.
Document the pros and cons of each approach.
9. DevOps for Data Engineering
Description: Set up CI/CD pipelines for a data engineering project.
Tech Stack: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, Terraform, Python.
Example:
Automate testing and deployment of a data pipeline.
Use Docker to containerize the project.
Deploy infrastructure with Terraform.
10. Open Source Contribution
Description: Contribute to an open-source data engineering tool or library.
Tech Stack: Varies based on the tool.
Example:
Contribute to Apache Airflow by writing a custom operator or improving documentation.
Build a plugin for dbt or add features to a Python data processing library.
